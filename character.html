                             <p>Born of a viking mother and bear father, Bödvar grew up feared and mistrusted by his own people. Bödvar’s first nemesis was the terrible giant bear Grothnar, his own brother. By defeating Grothnar in a battle that lasted seven days, Bödvar chose to side with humanity and became the protector of the people of the north. He led his Skandian people against the Witch Queen of Helheim, slew the White Dragon Sorcerer, and lived the life of an all-conquering hero. After he single-handedly ended the Giant Wars by trapping the fire giant king in his own volcano, Bödvar sensed his work was done. But he felt doomed to never be taken by the Valkyries to Valhalla because he could never manage to be defeated in battle. So he travelled to Asgard himself, broke down the doors, and let himself in.</p>

                             <p>When fifteen-year-old Cassidy Miller captured Wild Zeb and his gang, Zeb insisted his gun jammed and the sun was in his eyes. But, outlaws soon changed their tune, and just five years later, Bloody Cal Johnson bragged from prison that Utah had been forced to call in the great Marshal Cassidy just to bring him down. In her long career, Cassidy’s insistence on justice for all earned her many unlikely friends, including “the meanest horse in the West,” a giant cougar named Boots. But it also put her on the wrong side of the law when she joined the Underground Railroad and became a wanted fugitive herself. Later, Cassidy returned to law enforcement in dramatic style when President Lincoln begged her to track down the Bloodfang Rangers, a company of Confederate Vampires.</p>

                             <p> Watching from the doors of Valhalla, Bödvar, Cassidy and the other legends saw a blazing trail of smoke cut across the Asgardian sky. Behind the fiery comet, a Valkyrie raced in pursuit, as though trying to stop the fireball as it plunged into the fields of Folkvangr in a gout of dirt and flame. The legends then watched as Valkyries and emissaries of Odin gathered around the smoking crater. Weeks later, the Sons of Ivaldi, the same dwarven smiths who had forged Odin’s spear, quietly appeared in Asgard. They bore a suit of dazzling golden armor and presented it to the gods themselves. Soon after, the mighty Orion joined the feast halls of Valhalla.</p>

As a cadet pilot in the Zhaktar Academy for Conquest and Subjugation, he excelled in space dogfighting, spacedog fighting, judging the weak, and planetary immolation. As a young warlord, Vraxx destroyed Roldakk for harboring his childhood piano teacher, and soon built an impressive empire through fear, intimidation, brilliant space combat, and fear.  However, Vraxx’s extraordinary military prowess was always undermined by overconfidence, grandstanding, gloating, unworkable revenge plots, and general self-indulgence. He vaporized one planet because he didn’t like the color of their beaches, and disintegrated so many ill-performing generals that the rank of lieutenant colonel became known as ‘the sweet spot.’</p>

The lone hunter was called Long Fang by the saber-tooths, The Beast by the human clans, and Swift Death by the Primordials, an ancient race of savage cannibal apes. The ruthless Primordials drove humankind to the brink of extinction before Gnash emerged to stalk their steps. He devised the very first ‘plan’ when he drove the last of the Primordials through the Great Crevasse to the Valley of the Never Setting Sun and trapped them there with a giant avalanche.</p>

Neither the brilliant battlefield victories nor the cunning sorcery of the great Queen Nai could stem the tide of decline of her people or of her gods – a once great pantheon now faded to near extinction. Seeing that her civilization’s doom was sealed, Nai made a plan. She cast a spell, drawing into herself the essence of the eleven surviving gods of the Jaguar Kingdom. And when, during the Battle of Ixanocala, a Valkyrie offered Nai a place in Valhalla, she accepted, carrying Xanlecutli the Coatl, Eba the Snake, and nine other ailing gods with her to the great hall. </p>

For years, new warriors came to court every day only to be defeated. But on the day the Demon Kagima arrived to challenge her, Hattori sensed his malevolent power and fled.  Enraged, the Demon kidnapped Hattori’s three sisters and carried them away to his island kingdom. Horrified by the consequences of her actions, Hattori built a boat out of reeds and pursued the Demon. She was lost at sea until a stork lord showed her the passages between the twilight and the night to the Demon’s realm. There Hattori found a bizarre world of talking stones and eight-armed ferrymen. In the City of the Onyx Castle, she met Kagima’s own brother, who offered to give Hattori his strength to defeat his brother, in return for her hand in marriage. </p>

He beheld the Valkyrie Hypernia as she lifted up his defeated foe. Overcome by her beauty, Roland dedicated his life to gaining glory in hopes of seeing the Valkyrie again. For the next fifty years, the proud, bullheaded and charming Roland won more victories, made more enemies and broke more hearts than any knight of his time. His single-handed storming of the Fortress of Alsburg inspired forty-seven epic ballads and a Lifetime miniseries. Bards wrote songs about the song he wrote commemorating his victory over the Bilious Fire Drake. As an old man on his deathbed, Roland finally beheld Hypernia again. She could not allow a natural death to keep such a warrior from Valhalla, so, with a ghost of a smile, she punched him herself so he could die in battle and she could offer him a seat in the hall of glory.</p>

On an expedition to the remote Andes searching for the source of the mysterious aether-flux, she discovered a Lost World of dinosaurs, but was betrayed by her partner, the most beloved scientist of the age, Baron Von Evilstein. The Baron stole her inventions, framed Scarlet for his supposed murder, and vanished. Ten years later, the Baron emerged from the Lost World at the head of a vast armada of airships and dinosaur-riding ape warriors. One after another, the armies of the world fell before the Baron’s high-tech aether weapons, until Scarlet and her Royal Airship Navy were all that stood between the Baron and world domination. In the skies over the English Channel, Scarlet led the counterattack, finally defeating the Baron in a vast air battle that twice circumnavigated the globe.</p>

His love of black powder and obsession with setting the world aflame combined to sink hundreds of ships, sack dozens of ports, and prematurely erupt at least two volcanoes. Thatch’s ship had so many ghosts, they haunted in shifts. He plays his favorite drinking game, “Drink every time Thatch has a beard.” He claims to be married to the sea, and has a marriage license to prove it. He has a face only a mother could love if he hadn’t made her walk the plank. For Thatch, the Tournament is a paradise of chaos and fire, but even that doesn’t slake his thirst for mayhem. He aids in Vraxx’s schemes to conquer Valhalla out of sheer bloody-mindedness, and when bored will lay deadly traps he calls ‘pranks’ for his fellow Legends. He sneaks out at night to dig holes, knowing the gods must have buried treasure somewhere.</p>

After that, no official records of Ada exist. Part of an experimental group, Ada’s public education neuro-sims were replaced with training in real-time signal decryption and urban warfare. Graduates of the experiment joined Meyers Baby Food Corp’s black ops division, but Ada hacked the corporation’s maincloud and learned her division was protecting the Upload Enslavement Initiative. Soon, records of Meyers’ secret operations were playing on every news feed, and Ada had disappeared. In the undersea free state of Miami Dome, Ada founded the Right Wrong Cavaliers, an elite team of combat hackers and post-punk revival band, and she led their masterful guerilla campaign against Meyers and their shadowy GovernCorp backers. She’s pretty sure Valhalla is all some sort of computer sim, but until she can find a way out, she’s playing to win.</p>

                            <h2>Lucien</h2>
                             <p>In the dark violence of the French Revolution, Count Lucien Degas lived in Paris in decadent splendor. But by night, the mysterious Highwayman stalked the roads with his gang, preying on travelers without mercy. That is, until the price on his gang’s head grew to a hundred thousand francs. Then Lucien promoted his second-in-command and turned them all in for the reward.  He had always despised dividing his loot with inferiors, anyway. And indeed it was as a solo artist that The Highwayman became a figure of legendary dread. Relying on his own preternatural quickness and ruthless determination, he tried his hand at every sort of crime to bankroll his lavish living. Kidnapping, bank robbing, race fixing, art forgery, horse assassination, nothing was beneath Lucien. He wreaked havoc until his name became synonymous with avarice and violence.</p>

                             <p>The orphan boy-calf Teros relied on his terrible visage and instinct for sudden violence to survive on the streets of Dragonport. He got by as a stone carrier and debt collector until, in the gladiator pits, he found his true calling in reckless combat. He thrived in the ring, crushing cleverer foes with implacable fury and animal wile. In the end, he could only be pitted against the rare ogre or giant, and he moved on to a life of wandering. For a time, he carved out a place in Fangwild Forest, shouldering aside a wyvern and a hobgoblin clan. Later, he fell in with the Iron Legion, turning the tide of the Battle of Orc Pass for the Zombie Lord. His tenure as wizard’s henchman ended typically – with the evil mage shrieking to him, “Finish Them!” while fleeing through a magic portal. He lived for a while deep in Peril Mountain, where he found a strange comfort in the maze of abandoned tunnels.   </p>

                             <p>Children are rare among the immortals of Asgard, and every immortal with any heart came to love Hypernia’s daughter, the heir to her immortal mother’s impossible beauty and her human father’s legendary charm. Brynn grew up in every corner of Asgard. She made it her school and her playground. Raised to be a Valkyrie, she nonetheless can shoe an eight legged horse, weave the threads of fate with the Norns, and curse a blue streak in Dwarvish. As a Valkyrie, her sense for the mortal mind has helped her spot greatness in the most unlikely places, not just in princes on battlefields, holding their swords high. Three of her most shocking choices have won the Great Tournament. But Asgard is a vast society, and some don’t see Brynn as a true Asgardian, while her success has bred jealousy as well as admiration.</p>

                             <p>The villages along the Arit river on the Punjab border were proud of their guardian. Proud and more than a little scared. The Tiger was a gift from Rama, they said, though a gift rarely seen. Years might pass with only a giant paw print in the mud of the riverbank to prove that The Tiger still prowled the forests between the villages. But when raiders from the north or soldiers from the south came to steal and oppress, the signs of The Tiger would appear — bodies of invaders high in the trees, a would-be warlord mauled in his tent, an entire brigand camp shattered as though a typhoon had struck. And the villagers would wonder that anyone was left in the world so ignorant or so arrogant as to be heedless of their protector.</p>

                             <p>The Apocalypse came not on a missile but a mist. MBFC’s self-replicating nanobot cloud bricked anything that relied on computer circuitry, which in 2150 was everything. Deployed in desperation against a rogue agent’s hideout, the weaponized mist was supposed to become inert after twenty minutes. Fifty years later, Barraza was born in an abandoned aircraft carrier outside the girder wastes once called Los Angeles. All Barraza knew of this world was that he had to steal, scheme, and fight for every bite of food and every breath. Shot in the chest by The Gaslords and left for dead, he returned, kept alive by an artificial heart burning diesel and an iron will. Soon the Gaslords were dead, followed by the Ravagers, the Scorpions, the Battleborn, and every other challenger, until the man they called Diesel Heart ruled the wastes from Four Face Mountain to the Steel Wall. Waterhaulers, warbangers, zealots, radsuits, wastecroppers, junkers – all feared Diesel Heart.</p>

                             <p>No mortal has seen the center of the Fangwild Forest. The magic is too dense, the peril is too deep. Not the elves who live on the edges of the Fangwild. Not the adventurers and fools who brave the forest in search of paths to other universes. Not the ghouls and beasts drawn in by the call of magic.  No mortal but Ember. For thousands of years, Ember hunted the ever-changing paths of the Fangwild. With the wolf Ash and her raven Yarra, she guarded the Fangwild from itself, and protected the bordering worlds from the eldritch wood. She fought the Primordials. She befriended a lonely Minotaur. She rescued a furious viking lost deep in the Fangwild’s heart. She rode a wild dragon through the maelstrom at the heart of the forest. In ancient days before Valhalla, Fangwild’s borders touched even Asgard, and Ember walked with the first warriors among the mighty trees that would form its rafters. Now, amidst the glory of her afterlife in Valhalla, Ember’s mind is fixed on the Fangwild, and the Fangwild mourns its daughter. With Ember gone into Valhalla, the Fangwild has slipped into madness. Twisted and impassable, its wilds threaten to spill out across the many realms it touches. Ember knows there are paths both to and from Valhalla. She fights in the tournament, hoping that in victory she can find a way back and set things right in her forest home.</p>

From Polokus, Rayman learned that  the only way to defeat Mr. Dark was to find the lost Horn of Lums. Setting forth on his quest, Rayman ventured deep, deep into the forest. One day, after long travel and many adventures, Rayman emerged into a wide clearing. High on a hill he saw the huge golden hall and heard the roar of a vast crowd. Entering, Rayman was met by the sight of the Grand Tournament of Valhalla in full swing. Among the throng of cheering spectators, Rayman saw the god Odin wearing a “Sentinel #1” baseball cap and a Sir Roland jersey (it was 2v2s-day). Next to Odin sat the Tournament’s glorious pile of prizes. Sitting on top of the pile was the Horn of Lums.</p>

He hunted the Fangwild Forest and its neighboring lands, and everything he met was prey or plunder. The first years after Ember’s disappearance from the Fangwild were good for the dragons. Without its heart, the eldritch forest descended into chaos, opening paths to new lands to ravage. Ragnir’s favorite entrance to a new land was to emerge from an erupting volcano silhouetted against gouts of lava. In fire and battle, Ragnir’s hoard grew. He collected mountain hearts from unlucky dwarf kings. He wrested so much gold from the Madman of Barbados that he is the pirate’s Moby Dick. His Fangwild lair grew so vast it was mistaken for a city of gold.But now under mysterious assault, the forest is knotting itself into pure madness, and disaster looms. Ragnir knows the Fangwild’s only hope is to restore its Heart, and he journeyed to Asgard to bring Ember back.</p>
